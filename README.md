# Hawken-SBC-Tutorial-Files
This is a re-upload of related files for the "[Using a Steel Batallion Controller](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=240489890)" in Hawken's Guides on Steam.

While the game has been abandoned, and my site was redone (making all links non-functional), I am uploading them here for easier access in case people have an interest in the concept behind the tutorial.
